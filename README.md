Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Background

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The student should be required to submit:

a tidy data set,
a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that the student performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. The student should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
The data for the project can be downloaded from the link: UCI HAR Dataset.

R Project Introduction

For the purpose, one R script called run_analysis.R was developed, which does the following things:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set by using rbind() function to the traing and test data files: X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement by using regular expression function grep().
Uses descriptive activity names from activity_labels.txt to name the activities in the data set .
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names by using gsub() function to replace the abbreviated letters to some meaningful words from features.txt file.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set tidy_data.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. In this step, ddply() function was used to split data frame by (subject, activity), apply function('colMeans()' function), return Results in a new data frame. Finally the new data frame was written to the tidy_data.txt file by using 'write.table()' function.
